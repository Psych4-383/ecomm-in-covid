                <li>Traditional commerce and retail went down due to issues in sanitation and safefy of publis marketplaces</li>

            Q4) Will the Use of E-Commerce continue after the pandemic?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
            Answer: Reseach and analysis tells us that this increase in E-Commerce will likely continue after the pandemic as people have been exposed to a new way of retail that is easy, comfortable and secure. <br> That said, when stores open up, the crowds will be back, and people may start going to physical stores again. <br> Some research says that drive-throughs and pick-ups may be popularised as people try to spend lesser time in stores and merge e-commerce and traditional retail.
