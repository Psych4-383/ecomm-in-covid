            <p class="para" id="first-para">The COVID-19 crisis accelerated an expansion of
                e-commerce towards new firms, customers and types of products.
                It has provided customers with access to a significant variety of products from the convenience and
                safety
                of their homes, and has enabled firms to continue operation in spite of contact restrictions and other
                confinement measures.
                <br><br>
                Despite persistent cross-country differences, the COVID-19 crisis has
                enhanced dynamism in the e-commerce landscape across countries and has expanded
                the scope of e-commerce, including through new firms, consumer segments (e.g. elderly) and products
                (e.g. groceries). Meanwhile, e-commerce transactions in many countries have partly shifted from luxury
                goods
                and
                services towards everyday necessities, relevant to a large number of individuals.

                Despite the efforts of some governments
                to foster e-commerce during the COVID-19 crisis,
                persistent digital divides imply that not everyone
                has been able to participate. Moreover, regulations
                that are not adapted to e-commerce can create barriers
                to firms, such as in the case of emerging omni-channel sales
                models or new modes of delivery. While many of these challenges
                existed before COVID-19, the current crisis and the new role of
                e-commerce for individuals and firms has
                heightened the need for policy action. <br><br>
            <ul class="para points-ul" id="second-para">
                <li>
                    For consumers, systemic challenges related to connectivity, financial inclusion, skills and trust
                    (e.g.
                    digital security, privacy and consumer protection) have been brought into sharp relief. To address
                    this
                    issue, governments could expand affordable and quality broadband to rural and underserved areas,
                    enhance
                    financial inclusion, and foster trust and the acquisition of skills to participate in e-commerce.

                <li>
                    For firms, policy makers should reduce regulatory uncertainty to support the creation of innovative
                    business
                    models, e.g. in the context of an increasingly complementary relationship between offline and online
                    sales
                    strategies. <br> <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Governments also need to address the particular need of SMEs, including by ensuring a fair playing
                    field
                    in
                    the context of intermediated services (e.g. online platforms). Ensuring sufficient competition in
                    the
                    retail
                    sector and a well-functioning enabling environment for e-commerce, including communication services,
                    logistics or trade, is also crucial.
