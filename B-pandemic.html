                    Before pandemic, many big companies were already online and also had few trades in offline mode.
                    We can see in the above graph that even before pandemic E-commerce companies used to dominate the indian market
                    and almost always used to be in the top 10 most profitable companies in India like Amazon, big-basket, grofers, apple etc.
                    This shows the power and efficiency of doing trade through e-commerce.
                    It is way faster and quicker as compared to offline mode which has travel charges, weather conditions and much more problems resulting in loss of huge amounts of revenue for many companies.

                    Before the pandemic, e-commerce sales were not so popular and offline mode was preffered. This shows the mindset of the people at that time (2019 and before) but pandemic has shown that online is way better as it is more convinient than the other mode.<br>
                    It also allows people to have all the goods at one place (in this the website or app) hence saving tons of money for the people.<br>
                    If we look at the graph closely we can clearly see the fact that every year more or less, the rise was of about 2% which increased to about 5% during the pandemic. This shows the drastic change in the lives and mindset of the people. <br>
                    We strongly recommend online shopping and e-commerce buisness and encourage others to raise awareness about the same for the betterment of the lives of the people.

                    Amazon is a buisness giant heavily dependent on e-commerce for its revenue. <br>
                    It is a goods providing company that provides essentials at door step. Due to it being dependent on ecommerce, it has grown tremendously to whole world. <br>
                    Its CEO, Jeff Bezos was recently the world's richest for a brief period and now is ranking no. 2 in the world's richest people. <br>
                    Amazon has always been one of the most profitable companies in India.
                    It has grown exponentially from earning a meager profit of 6.92 billion to 280.52 billion dollars before pandemic.

                    This shows that E-commerce is so beneficial that is also brings employement to many people adding to its never ending list of specialities and advantages. <br>
                    During pandemic the numbers have risen shariply as many people got unemployed due to small companies firing them due to insufficient revenue due to being in buisness offline.
                    This increase in employement rate has brought in tremendous amounts of revenue as well as has helped millions to get an income.<BR>
                    We should really be thankful for ecommerce.

                <p id="para-1-1" style="width: 50%; margin: 0px; float:left; margin-top: 100px;">
                    We can see that during the pandemic PayTM didn't get affected that much as it was already dependent on e-commerce. 
                    But as we can see that PayTM considerable reduction in terms of losses hence increasing the overall revenue.
                    This was so because that it previously had been about 80-90% online and 10-20% offline.
                    But after pandemic the situation changed due to lockdown with people heavily dependent on the PayTM app for transactions.

                <p id="para-1-1" style="width: 50%; margin: 0px; float:right;margin-top:50px;">
                    We can see in this data that PayTM is the most preffered single mode of digital payment and transaction.
                    Its easy to use app, features and availability at every local shop make it a convinient method of payment and attracts users hence making its user base even larger.
