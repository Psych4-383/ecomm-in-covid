            In 2020, e-commerce skyrocketed and online retailing companies underwent huge boosts in sales as people
            switched from physical shopping to online commerce. <br>
            Some companies like Amazon, AliBaba and eBay took the leads, and their sales expanded enormously. Given is a
            visual representation of the leading e-commerce countries in the year 2020. <br>
            Amazon has outdone all the other retail companies with a huge margin, its revenue almost thrice as much as
            the company in second place, JD.com

            Due to increased online commerce, the share of e-commerce in global retail increased tremendously. It went
            from 13.6% of global retail to 18%, a whopping 32% increase in its share, almost thrice the increase in the
            previous year. In 2018-2019, the share had been approximately 11%.
            <br><br>
            It is clear and evident that E-Commerce has gained ground over the course of the last year and a half.
            Statistics predict that this increase in the use of online shopping and transactions is unlikely to go down
            in the coming years as people have been introduced to many new and easier ways of retail. <br><br> Consumers
            will be going to physical shops post-pandemic but the boost in online-shopping will likely not go down
            drastically.

            Amazon is an e-commerce company, selling various items, straight from the seller to the buyer. It is an
            international business, and has spread from general e-commerce to even groceries and essentials lately
            It is one of the leading e-retailers in the world, and has a net sale of approximately 386 billion US
            dollars as of 2020. <br> <br>
            Amazon's revenue increased tremendously as it the already popular e-commerce site began being used by more
            people, more often. <br><br> We can see a 37% rise in its revenue from 2019 to 2020. Even though Amazon
            started giving priority to essentials during the lockdowns, delivering home supplies and medicines before
            things in the genre of entertainment, people depended heavily on this site for most of their needs. We can
            visualise the increase in its revenue using the chart given here.

                In the first Quarter of the year 2020, the sales in Amazon actually went down due to people not
                trusting home-delivery. The sales boosted up once again as lockdowns were imposed everywhere.
